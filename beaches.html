    <h1>List of top beaches to visit </h1>
    <p>One of the most popular tourist attractions in the Philippines are the beaches. There are many beautiful beaches to visit when traveling to the Philippines. Below is a list of beaches that I recommend you visit when traveling to the country. </p>

            <br>Far off on the island of Palawan is the idyllic El Nido. You’ll find a few spectacular beaches here such as Buena Suerte Beach, Caalan beach, Papaya Beach, Yoga Beach, and more. In El Nido, every beach is more jaw-dropping than the next. El Nido beaches have become a ‘bucket list’ destination for travelers as they are perfectly picturesque and accessible while being mysterious and full of adventure.

      <dt>Cagayan Valley, Palaui Island</dt>
        <br>
        <dd>
            <img src="CagayanValley.jpg" alt="Cagayan" width="300px" height="200px">
            <br>Cagayan Valley on Palaui Island doesn’t feel real. While bathing in the warm water looking upon the shore, not only will you gaze upon bright white beaches, but also volcanic mountains and rolling hills with no development in sight. Often referred to as a beach that encapsulates “raw beauty”, Cagayan Valley is stunning. Visit Egaño Cove where you can visit a World War II lighthouse that almost feels out of place. Take the 229-step concrete stairway to the top for stunning views.</dd>
        <br>
      <dt>White Beach, Boracay </dt>
        <br>
        <dd><img src="WhiteBeachBoracay.jpg" alt="White Beach" width="300px" height="200px">
            <br>
        White Beach on Boracay is where beach dreams come true. White sand, turquoise water, lounge chairs with umbrellas and palm trees bending towards the water. Even during high season when most tourists flock to this paradise island, White Beach is still totally enjoyable. It’s a 4km beach, which means there is room for everyone.Lots of water activities happen off the shore of this beach such as parasailing, kayaking, and banana boat rides. Or if you prefer, stay in your lounge chair while hawkers offer your beverages, food, and jewelry.</dd>
        <br>
      <dt>Alona Beach, Panglao</dt>
        <br>
        <dd><img src="AlonaBeachPanglao.jpg" alt="Alona Beach" width="300px" height="200px"><br>Alona beach is located on the tiny kidney bean-shaped island called Pangloa. This may be one of the smallest tourist islands in the Visayas but it has a lot to offer in terms of pristine beachfront property. You can stay in a top-tier resort, comfy guesthouse, or dirt cheap hostel and still enjoy the same tropical oasis. Ditch the beach towel- the sand is so soft! Lying at the waters edge with your toes in the sand and a beer in your hand is what every country song sings about and you can make that country some come true on Alona Beach! There are tons of fabulous bars here that encourage day drinking!

      <dt>Dumaluan Beach, Panglao</dt>
        <br>
        <dd><img src="DumaluanBeach.jpg" alt="Dumaluan Beach" width="300px" height="200px"><br>If you’re looking for a bit of privacy on your beach holiday, book a stay at one of the few resorts on Dumaluan Beach. When you stay at Bohol Beach Club, South Palms Resort, or Dumaluan Beach Resort, you are guaranteed exclusive access to this 3km stretch of tropical heaven. The staff from the resorts do an impeccable job of maintaining the grounds. They also put out colorful beanbag chairs and umbrellas alongside the most comfortable lounge chairs. Did I mention there are hammocks?

      <dt>Paradise Beach, Bantayan Island</dt>
        <br>
        <dd><img src="Paradise-Beach-Bantayan-Island.jpg" alt="Paradise Beach" width="300px" height="200px"><br>A honeymooner’s paradise can be found on the small island of Bantayan Island just west of Cebu. Most months out of the year, couples will find themselves totally alone. This desolate beach turns adult couples into playful little children who can forget the world while splashing in the water, running barefoot in the sand and taking to the jungles to explore paths trodden by few adventurers before them. There are no distractions here- no resorts, bars, or jewelry hawkers- most of the year, anyways. However, the weekend before Easter is a popular time for Filipinos to travel and since Bantayan Island is within such close proximity to Cebu, expect a sudden rush of tourists.

      <dt>Caramoan, Camarines Sur</dt>
        <br>
        <dd><img src="ccimage-shutterstock_388894342.jpg" alt="Caramoan" width="300px" height="200px"><br>‘Survivor’ fans might geek out while visiting Camarines Sur. This island and it’s beaches- particularly Caramoan beach- has been used as the site for two ‘Survivor’ seasons back in 2010. This beach is so beautiful, that the French version of ‘Survivor’ decided to follow suit with producers saying, “We chose Caramoan because it’s really wild. It’s necessary that contestants don’t see anything other than nature for them to believe that they’re really lost in the wilds.” Not everything you see on TV is true to reality, however. While the beaches may be untouched, the 107-square mile Camarines Sur is home to 47,000 local residents. This island actually has a lot to offer in terms of shops, stores, and supermarkets. Buy some flip-flops in town, pack a lunch from the supermarket and grab a couple beers from a small shop- then head down to Caramoan Beach.

      <dt>Babau Santa Beach Resort, Talicud Island</dt>
        <br>
        <dd><img src="Babau-Santa-Beach-Resort-Talicud-Island.jpg" alt="Babau Santa Beach" width="300px" height="200px"><br>Visiting Davao actually means that you get two islands in one and one of the best beaches to visit- Babau Santa Beach Resort. This private little island makes for the perfect day trip. Charter a private boat to take you to a beach where you will have tons of privacy. This beach is the kind of beach you could spend all day lounging on with friends, reading a book solo, or brushing up on your photography skills. The shore is very shallow which means you can wade out quite a ways and experience bathwater temperatures! Lay down in the water near the shore to get the perfect tan without having to battle strong currents or waves or getting too hot on the sand.

      <dt>Canibad Beach Cove, Samal</dt>
        <br>
        <dd><img src="Canibad-Beach-Cove-Samal.jpg" alt="Canibad Beach cove" width="300px" height="200px"><br>As the Philippines become more and more popular, it becomes harder and harder to find those elusive secluded beaches where you are the only humans in sight. When you find one of those beaches still existing in 2017, you jump on the chance to visit. Canibad Beach Cove on Samal island is one of those elusive spots because it takes some effort to reach. Located in the Penalata District, you’ll have to hire a private charter to zip you around to the Davao Oriental-facing side of Samal.  Once you’re there, you’ll almost certainly be the only ones. You won’t find any fancy restaurants or shops, so bring your own snorkel gear and towels! This would be the ideal spot for a sexy photo shoot or a super private marriage proposal!

      <dt>The Island Buenavista</dt>
        <dd><img src="Island-Buenavista.jpg" alt="Island Buenavista" width="300px" height="200px"><br>Ever wanted your own private island? Well, you can make that dream come true on The Island Buenavista. This small island is inhabited by one beach resort that rents the island out to only one group at a time for an all-inclusive day pass or overnight stay.Group packages start with 10 people for around $740 per day. That includes transport from Davao airport, meals, drinks, and activities like kayaking and snorkeling- the whole shebang. What a steal!
