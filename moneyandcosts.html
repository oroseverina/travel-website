<h1 align="center">Money and Costs</h1> 
<p align="center"> The official currency of the Philippines is the Philippine peso (P). On this page you will find some helpful information on using and mangaging your money during your trip to the philippines. </p>
    
<h4 align="center">Bargaining</h4>
    
<p align="center">A modest amount of negotiating is expected in many outdoor markets, especially where tourist handicrafts are sold. However, prices for food commodities are usually set.

Bargaining is the rule when hiring motorbikes, or hiring tricycles, bangkas or taxis for the day. Bargaining may also bear fruit when you're walking into hotels, especially in resort areas in the low season.</p>
    
<h4 align="center">Money</h4>

<p>ATMs dispensing pesos are widely available. Credit cards are accepted at hotels, restaurants and some shops in all but remote areas.
</p>

<h6>ATMS</h6>
    
<ul>
   <li>Prevalent in any decent-sized provincial city; dispense pesos.</li> 
    <li>More remote towns do not have ATMs.</li>
    <li>The most prevalent ATMs that accept most Western bank cards belong to Banco de Oro (BDO), Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and Metrobank.</li>
    <li>Standard ATM charge is P200 per withdrawal.</li>
    <li>Most ATMs have a P10,000 to P15,000 per-transaction withdrawal limit. Exception: HSBC ATMs in Manila and Cebu let you take out P40,000 per transaction.</li>
        
</ul>

<h6>Cash</h6>
    
<ul>
  <li>Cash in US dollars is a good thing to have in case you get stuck in an area with no working ATM. Other currencies, such as the euro or UK pound, are more difficult to change outside of the bigger cities.</li> 
    <li>‘Sorry, no change’ becomes a very familiar line in the provinces. Stock up on coins and P20, P50 and P100 notes at every opportunity.</li>
    
</ul>
    
<h6 id="credit cards">Credit Cards</h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Major credit cards are accepted by most hotels, high-end restaurants and businesses in Manila, Cebu City and other large cities.</li>
        <li>Outside of large cities, you may be charged an extra 3% to 5% for credit-card transactions.</li>
        <li>Most Philippine banks will let you take a cash advance on your card.</li>
    </ul>
<h6 id="exchangerate">Exchange Rates</h6>
<p>The exhange rate from one currency tot he Philippine peso can change at anytime. It is recommended that you check the exchange rate closer to you arrival in the Philippines. Start off with exhanging a small amount of many and exchange more as needed. Check exchange rates here: www.xe.com </p>
