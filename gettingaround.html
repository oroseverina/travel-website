<p align="center">Traveling around the Philippines can be hard. The Philippines is an archipelago, that's made up with 7,641 island. Traveling around and to/from Island can be difficult. Below is a map to help travelrs visualize and see the different island of the Philippines </p>

<h2 align="center">Means of transportation in the Philippines.</h2>

    <h4>Air</h4>
    <p>The main domestic carriers are: <p><a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/">AirAsia</a>, <a href="https://www.cebupacificair.com/?en-ph">Cebu Pacific</a> and, <a href="https://www.philippineairlines.com/en>Philippine airlines">Philippine airlines</a></p>
    
<!BULLETED LIST FOR TIPS>   
    <p>Here are some domestic booking tips</p>
    
 <ul>
  <li>Pay attention to baggage allowances – some routes and airlines are more restrictive than others.</li>
     <br>
  <li>Pre-pay for your baggage online or you'll pay triple at the check-in counter.</li>
     <br>
  <li>If you book a month or so in advance, you’ll rarely pay more than P1500 (about US$30) for a one-way ticket on the main carriers (exceptions on touristy routes such as Manila–Caticlan and Manila–Siargao, and during peak domestic-travel periods).</li>
     <br>
  <li>On most airlines you will not pay a premium for one-way tickets nor save money by purchasing a round-trip ticket.</li>
     <br>
  <li>Flight routes are skewed towards Manila and (to a lesser extent) Cebu. If you want to fly between any other cities you’ll likely have to purchase two tickets and transfer through one of those hubs. Air Juan's inter-regional flights are improving the situation somewhat.</li>
     <br>
  <li>Don’t plan too tight a schedule for connecting flights; flight delays are a fact of life in the Philippines.</li>
     <br>
  <li>Typhoons and other serious weather often ground planes from July to December – some routes are more susceptible than others.</li>
     <br>
  <li>A good way to avoid delays is to depart extremely early in the morning, before runway congestion disrupts schedules.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Bicycle">Bicycle</h4>

    <p>If you’re away from the traffic and exhaust fumes of major cities, cycling can be a great way to get around quieter, less-visited islands.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>You can take bicycles on domestic flights (you may have to partially disassemble the bicycle), but take heed of the baggage allowance on small planes.</li>
        
    <li>In the big cities you will find bicycle shops where you can purchase brand-new bikes of varying quality. Outdoor-gear shops (most malls have at least one) are good places to enquire about local cycling clubs and events</li>
    
    <li>If there’s room, you can stow your bike on a bus or jeepney, usually for a small charge.</li>
    
    </ul>

<h4 id="Boat">Boat</h4>

    <p>The islands of the Philippines are linked by an incredible network of ferry routes, and prices are generally affordable. Ferries usually take the form of motorised outriggers (known locally as bangkas), speedy ‘fastcraft’ vessels, roll-on, roll-off ferries (ROROs; car ferries) and, for long-haul journeys, vast multidecked passenger ferries. It's worth highlighting the mega company 2GO Travel (www.travel.2go.com.ph), which serves the majority of major destinations in the Philippines.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can check out the real-time locations of the various larger ferries plying the waters at www.marinetraffic.com. The website www.schedule.ph is not entirely comprehensive but it’s a good place to start for ferry schedules.</p>

  <tr>
    <th>Type of boat/name</th>
    <th>Description</th> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bangkas</td>
    <td>The jeepneys of the sea, also known as pumpboats. They are small wooden boats with two wooden or bamboo outriggers. Bangka ferries ply regular routes between islands and are also available for hire per day for diving, snorkelling, sightseeing or just getting around</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Fastcraft"</td>
    <td>These are passenger only, and are mainly used on popular short-haul routes; they cut travel times by half but usually cost twice as much as slower RORO ferries. One modern convenience used to excess on these spiffy ships is air-conditioning</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ROROs</td>
    <td>Popular on medium-haul routes, especially along the so-called ‘Nautical Highway’ running from Manila to Davao in southern Mindanao. ROROs are slow but, in good weather, are the most enjoyable form of ocean transport, as (unlike most fastcraft) they allow you to sit outside in the open air and watch the ocean drift by.</td>
